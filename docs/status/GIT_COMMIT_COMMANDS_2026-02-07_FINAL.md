# Git Status: CLEAN & READY

Good news! Analysis of your `git log` shows that **all changes are already committed**:

1. **Docs & Spec**: `4d5f116` (includes `PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md`)
2. **Backend**: `f4c8052`
3. **Frontend**: `a89a2c8`

The "no changes added to commit" error occurred because you were trying to commit files that were already safely stored.

## Next Step
You are ready to push to the remote repository.

```bash
git push origin main
```
