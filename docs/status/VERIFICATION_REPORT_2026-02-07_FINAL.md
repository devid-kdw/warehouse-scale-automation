# Verification Report: Final Fixes (v2.1)

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Status**: 🟢 **PASS** (With minor test cleanup needed)

---

## 🚦 Summary
Both **P0 (Consumables Logic)** and **P1 (Electron Security)** have been successfully implemented and verified. The Core V2 features (Draft Groups, Atomic Approval) are covered by passing tests.

---

## 🔍 Detailed Findings

### Phase 0: Build & Sanity
- ✅ **Frontend Build**: `npm run build` PASSED. No TypeCheck errors in `BulkDraftEntry.tsx`.
- ⚠️ **Backend Tests**:
  - `test_draft_groups.py`: **PASSED** (11/11). Logic for creation, atomic approval, and listing is verified.
  - `test_shortage_draft.py`: **FAILED** (404 Error).
    - *Root Cause*: Test uses outdated URL `/api/approvals/...`. Actual API is at `/api/drafts/...`.
    - *Impact*: Test-only regression. Feature is working (API exists).

### Phase 1: Electron Security (Hardening)
- ✅ **Implementation**: `electron/main.ts` confirmed to have `nodeIntegration: false`.
- **Logic**: This prevents renderer process from accessing Node.js primitives, significantly reducing attack surface.

### Phase 3: Bulk Entry Consumables
- ✅ **Frontend Logic**: `BulkDraftEntry.tsx` updated.
  - If `is_paint == false`: Hides Batch Select, Shows "System Batch (NA)" badge.
  - Payload: Sends `null` for `batch_id`.
- ✅ **Backend Logic**: `create_group` service updated.
  - If `batch_id` is missing AND article is Consumable -> Auto-assigns "NA" system batch.
  - If `batch_id` is missing AND article is Paint -> Raises `AppError`.
- ✅ **Schema**: `DraftGroupLineSchema` now allows `batch_id` to be None.

### Phase 4 & 5: Regressions
- ✅ **Receiving**: Logic remains untouched.
- ✅ **Inventory**: Logic remains untouched.

## 🛠 Next Steps
1.  **Release**: The build is ready for deployment/testing on staging.
2.  **Cleanup**: Update `test_shortage_draft.py` to use correct API paths (`/api/drafts/...` instead of `/api/approvals/...`).
