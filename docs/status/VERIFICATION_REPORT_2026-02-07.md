# Verification Report: Core Refinement v2

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Status**: 🟡 **PARTIAL PASS** (Requires 1 Fix)

---

## 🚦 Summary
Implementation is **90% complete**. Critical backend protections (Atomicity, Order Numbers) and most UI flows (Receiving, Inventory, Operator Entry) are **PASSING**.

**Critical Issue**: Admin **Bulk Entry** ignores "Consumables" logic (Phase 3). User is forced to select a batch for consumable items, violating the spec.

---

## 🔍 Detailed Findings

### Phase 0: Setup & Sanity
- **Migrations**: `c8f64cf6440c` exists. (Execution failed due to env, but code valid).
- **Security**: ⚠️ `nodeIntegration: true` found in `electron/main.ts`. **HIGH RISK**. Use `contextIsolation` without `nodeIntegration` in production.
- **Build**: Frontend builds successfully.

### Phase 1: Role & Routing
- ✅ **Admin Guard**: `/drafts/bulk` is protected by `<RequireAdmin>`.
- ✅ **Sidebar**: "Bulk Entry" hidden from Operators.

### Phase 2: Draft Entry (Operator)
- ✅ **Toggle**: Implemented & persisted.
- ✅ **Barcode**: Non-invasive listener logic present.

### Phase 3: Bulk Entry & Groups
- ✅ **Location**: Fixed to 13.
- ✅ **Auto-fill**: Works for Description, Mfr, UOM.
- 🔴 **FAIL (Consumables)**:
  - **Issue**: `BulkDraftEntry.tsx` Row component does not check `is_paint` or `uom`.
  - **Result**: Batch dropdown is shown for Consumables. If no batches exist, user is stuck.
  - **Fix Required**: Hide Batch Select if `article.is_paint === false`, auto-send `batch_id` corresponding to logical "NA" or let backend handle it.
- ✅ **Atomicity**: Backend `draft_group_service.py` correctly pre-checks stock/surplus before execution.

### Phase 4: Receiving
- ✅ **Order Number**: Required field implemented.
- ✅ **Consumables**: UI correctly hides Batch/Expiry for consumables.
- ✅ **Backend**: `Transaction` model includes `order_number` and indexes.

### Phase 5 & 6: History & Inventory
- ✅ **Receipt History**: Grouped by Order Number, correct drill-down.
- ✅ **Inventory Tabs**: "Paint" vs "Consumables" tabs working.
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Retry button present.

## 🛠 Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Before Release)
1.  **Fix Bulk Entry**: Update `BulkDraftEntry.tsx` to detect Consumables and hide/disable Batch selection.
2.  **Electron Security**: If possible, disable `nodeIntegration` or document exception.

### Pass/Fail Matrix
| Phase | Feature | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Migrations/Tests | ⚠️ (Env issues, Code looks OK) |
| 1 | Roles/Routing | ✅ PASS |
| 2 | Operator Entry | ✅ PASS |
| 3 | Bulk Entry | 🔴 **FAIL** (Consumables logic) |
| 4 | Receiving | ✅ PASS |
| 5 | Receipt History | ✅ PASS |
| 6 | Inventory View | ✅ PASS |
