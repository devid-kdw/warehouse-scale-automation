**Week**: 03 Feb - 09 Feb 2026  
**Reported by**: Orchestrator  
**Date**: 2026-02-03

---

## ✅ Completed This Week

- **Project review completed** - comprehensive analysis of warehouse-scale-automation
- **Documentation infrastructure established**:
  - Created `docs/team/` structure (CHANGELOG, DECISIONS, MIGRATIONS, AGENTS, RELEASE_CHECKLIST)
  - Created `docs/status/` for weekly reports
  - Created `docs/tasks/` for task briefs with templates
- **Critical feature gaps identified**:
  - No receiving/inbound workflow (STOCK_RECEIPT)
  - Transaction reports UI needs improvement
  - Batch expiry enforcement needed
- **Decision log created** with 9 documented architectural decisions
- **Migration log created** - all 3 existing migrations documented

---

## 🔄 In Progress

- **Receiving workflow specification** - detailed addendum created with:
  - Batch expiry mismatch rules (409 error)
  - Inventory count workflow (surplus vs shortage handling)
  - API contract for `POST /api/inventory/receive`
  - RBAC rules (admin-only)

---

## 📅 Planned Next Week

- **Create Task Brief** for receiving workflow implementation (TASK-001)
- **Backend implementation** of receiving endpoint
- **Frontend implementation** of ReceiveStock page/modal
- **Update root README.md** with links to new documentation structure
- **First smoke test** of receiving workflow

---

## ⚠️ Risks / Blockers

- **None currently** - all prerequisites documented and clear

---

## 🧪 How to Test Recent Changes

### Documentation Review

1. **Verify folder structure**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/grzzi/Desktop/Paint\ Manager/warehouse-scale-automation
   ls -la docs/team/
   ls -la docs/status/
   ls -la docs/tasks/
   ```
   Expected: CHANGELOG.md, DECISIONS.md, MIGRATIONS.md, AGENTS.md, RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md, templates

2. **Review decision log**:
   - Open `docs/team/DECISIONS.md`
   - Verify 9 decisions documented (location policy, expiry rules, RBAC, etc.)

3. **Review migration log**:
   - Open `docs/team/MIGRATIONS.md`
   - Verify 3 existing migrations documented with rollback instructions

## 📊 Current State

**Version**: v1.1.0 (current)

**Known Limitations**:
- ❌ No receiving/inbound workflow
- ❌ Transaction reports UI basic
- ⚠️ Batch expiry not enforced (warning only)

**Core Features Working**:
- ✅ JWT authentication + RBAC
- ✅ Draft approval workflow (weigh-in → approve)
- ✅ Inventory count with surplus/shortage
- ✅ Expiry tracking with visual warnings (red/orange/gray)
- ✅ Inventory summary view
- ✅ Article/batch management

**Test Status**:
- Backend: 10 test files, all passing
- Frontend: Build succeeds, no TypeScript errors
- Migrations: 3 migrations tracked

---

## 📝 Notes

### Architecture Highlights
- **Excellent approval service** - atomic operations with row-level locking
- **Clean separation of concerns** - models, schemas, services, API endpoints
- **Comprehensive audit trail** - all inventory changes tracked in transactions
- **Role-based UI** - operator sees only draft entry, admin sees everything

### Technical Debt
- None identified yet (new project)

### Next Sprint Focus
**Priority 1**: Implement receiving workflow
- Backend: 5-7 hours estimated
- Frontend: 3-4 hours estimated
- Testing: 1 hour

**Priority 2**: Batch expiry enforcement
- Backend validation: 1 hour
- Frontend required field: 1 hour

---

**Changes Not to Touch**:
- ✅ Core approval logic (`approval_service.py`) - well-tested, production-ready
- ✅ Authentication/JWT implementation - working correctly
- ✅ Database schema - all migrations tracked and applied

---

**Documentation Status**: ✅ Up to date as of 2026-02-03
